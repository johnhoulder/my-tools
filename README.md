# My Tools
This is a list of tools I use for day to day working. This repo will also eventually include any custom tools I might use.

### HTTPie
HTTPie is a more user-friendly version of cURL that gives a pretty output of data and has friendlier parameters.

### jq
jq is a tool that essentially pretty prints JSON piped into it in the CLI.

### jid
jid is just like jq except it allows you to interact with the JSON in various ways such as filtering in real time or finding a specific value.

### http-prompt
http-prompt is an interactive version of HTTPie. It allows you to navigate a website in what is essentially a shell-like way using commands such as `cd` to navigate to different levels.

### autojump
Autojump is a tool that works by maintaining a database of the directories you use the most from the command line allowing you to jump back to them quickly based on different things such as the files they contain.

### peco
Peco is a cool tool that allows you to filter anything like grep except in an interactive way so that you can "filter as you think".
